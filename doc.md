# DSA Vault -- Implementation Guide for Continuation

> This document is for any Claude model continuing this vault build.
> Read this ENTIRELY before writing a single file. These are hard rules.

---

## Context

This is an Obsidian vault at `c:\USER_DATA\SHIVAM\dat\vaults\vaults\SDE`.
The user is a student targeting SDE and Quant placements at top-tier companies (FAANG, quant firms, top Indian product companies).
The DSA notes go inside `DSA/` folder.
Git is initialized. Commit after each chapter completes.

---

## Behavior Rules (CRITICAL)

- **ZERO verbosity in chat.** Do not explain what you just did. Do not say "here is what I created". Do not use emojis. Do not use em-dashes. No sycophantic openers. No closing fluff.
- After every chapter commit, **stop and ask only "Continue?"** -- nothing else.
- **Token efficiency**: write content, not commentary about the content.
- User's exact words: *"dont waste tokens telling me what you are doing"*

---

## Content Rules

### Language
- **C++20 only.** No Python, no Java.
- For non-trivial C++20 features (`std::span`, `std::ranges`, structured bindings, `std::erase_if`, etc.), add a short comment explaining what it is and why it is used.
- Write the **simple/normal way first**, then show the modern C++ shorthand below it.
- Avoid overly complex syntax that would confuse a junior (no `int i(0uz)` style C++23 things).

### Structure Per Chapter
Every chapter folder must contain these files in order:

```
00_Index.md                 <- table of files, nav links
01_Foundations.md           <- (for complex topics like Trees, LL) basics first
01_Patterns.md OR 02_Patterns.md  <- all patterns with full C++ code
02/03_Problems_and_Exercises.md   <- 4-tier problem table + 2 worked solutions
LAST_Tricky.md              <- hard/higher-order interview questions (REQUIRED for every chapter)
```

### Note Format Per File
1. YAML frontmatter with `tags` and `links`
2. Navigation links at top and bottom: `*<- [[prev]] · [[next ->]]*`
3. Trivial explanation FIRST, complex logic AFTER with "why" reasoning
4. Every pattern: explain visually with ASCII walkthrough, then full C++ code
5. Every code block: labeled with the problem source if applicable

### Tricky File (MANDATORY for every chapter)
This is the most important file per chapter. Contains:
- Problems that are NOT obvious applications of the chapter's patterns
- Higher-order thinking: e.g., Binary Search on an infinite array, Graphs with multiple sources BFS, DP on a tree, etc.
- Interview-level insights that distinguish good from great candidates
- Each problem has a "Why tricky" section BEFORE the solution
- Problem table at the end linking to LC/GFG/Codeforces

### Exercises Format
4 tiers, always:
- **Tier 1**: Foundations (all easy, solve all)
- **Tier 2**: Core patterns (medium, solve all)
- **Tier 3**: Interview level (medium-hard, solve at least 5)
- **Tier 4**: Placement-hard / OA-level (hard, do what you can)

Difficulty tags: `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard` (LeetCode style).
Every problem must have: problem number + platform link.
Preferred platforms: LeetCode > GFG > Codeforces.

### Obsidian Graph View
- Every file has YAML `tags` and `links` arrays
- Navigation links `[[prev]]` and `[[next]]` at top and bottom of every file
- Index files link to all sub-files in the chapter
- `00_Home.md` links to all chapter indexes

## Curriculum Sources

- **NeetCode.io roadmap** (the image attached by user): Arrays->Two Pointers->Stack->Binary Search->Sliding Window->Linked List->Trees->Tries->Heap->Backtracking->Graphs->Advanced Graphs->1D DP->2D DP->Greedy->Intervals->Bit Manipulation->Math
- **TakeUForward (Striver's SDE Sheet)**: extends NeetCode with harder variants, especially in DP and Graphs
- **Aditya Verma (YouTube)**: known for DP series (Knapsack variants as foundation for all DP) and Backtracking/Recursion style

The notes go BEYOND NeetCode into TakeUForward territory specifically for:
- DP (full 9-subtype structure above)
- Graph algorithms (SCC, bridges, articulation points)
- String algorithms (KMP, Z, Manacher)
- Number theory
